Halifax - Shadow Map

Location: Downtown Halifax - centered around the downtown area.

Time: December 21 (winter solstice), ~ 12:00 PM local time

About the map:

Blue shading

Darker blue indicates areas with deeper or more persistent shadow.

Lighter blue indicates partial or weaker shadow.

White building footprints show the built environment used to generate shadows.

Small yellow highlights represent concentrations of street lights, shown softly to indicate areas of night time illumination rather than precise lighting intensity.

Water/ Sea and non-built areas are shown in light grey/ white for contrast.

Purpose

This map is a preliminary visual representation to explore how seasonal shadows reflect the daily use of urban space in winter. The density of buildings, the placement of streetlights, and areas with long, deep shadows are all important. Shadow maps can be explored as a tool to understand the daily changes in the area's population, providing an accurate representation of reality.

Note

This map is only a preliminary draft based on a specific date and time and is intended to support discussion and further exploration of aspects that require deeper study, rather than serving as a final analytical product.
